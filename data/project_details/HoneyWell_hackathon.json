    "Developed a production-ready anomaly detection pipeline that trains a Random Forest classifier, scales features, and applies Z‑score based deviation scoring to flag sensor anomalies with a weighted 1–100% score.",
    "Engineered feature importance extraction to surface the top 7 contributing attributes for each flagged anomaly, enabling actionable insights for quality control teams.",
    "Containerized the solution with a .devcontainer, packaged the model, scaler, and statistical parameters into pickle files, and generated comprehensive CSV outputs for downstream analysis."
