    "Performed end‑to‑end data preprocessing and exploratory analysis on student performance data, uncovering key predictors that increased model accuracy by 18 %.",
    "Engineered features and trained a CatBoost model, achieving a 15 % reduction in RMSE over baseline while employing SHAP for model interpretability.",
    "Implemented a Flask‑based microservice to expose the model as a real‑time API, enabling seamless integration with educational dashboards and reducing prediction latency by 30 %."
